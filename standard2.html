    <h4>Solve a Project Euler Problem</h4>
    <p class="intro">Project Euler Problem 3</p>
    <p>What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143?</p>
    <p>I thought this problem was really challenging, and I had a great time coming up with a solution! I took a granular approach, so the first thing I did was explore what a prime number is. I did some research on primality testing and stayed focused on
      prime numbers.
    </p>
    <p>Then, I sought to write a javascript function that could determine if a number was prime or composite. When I succeeded in my endeavor, I then built a web page and incorporated the javascript into an HTML form(just for fun).</p>

    <p>Having the logic for primality testing, I thought the hard part was over. The next logical step was to write a script that would collect all the factors of a number. Using the modulus operator, this was simple enough. Ultimately, the script would
      collect all the prime factors of a number and then return the largest prime factor. I tested the script on the first test case of the project Euler problem and it was successful. The test case was: The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
      I proceeded to do that thing people do when the Denver Broncos score, and then took a break! When I came back to run the script to find the answer to the problem with the number 600851475143, it crashed.</p>
    <p> The algorithm was not efficient. It was not possible to iterate through a number that large. I was stuck and had to chew on this problem deeper. I removed myself from the text editor, stepped away from writing scripts, did some more research on primality
      testing, and got a good night's sleep. Came back to it the next morning and created a solution that did not require iterating through the entire number. Learning that there could not be a prime factor greater than the square root of the number in
      question, I was able to create a solution that did not require iterating through the entire number. With that knowledge, I was able to create a much more efficient script and produce the answer to the problem.</p>
    <p>
      Fun Stuff!
